- change Eigen operations to column-major
	Currently most loops are row-major increasing the probabilty of chache misses
- set mass units to AU everywhere, set THz units as optional
- provide interface to PerfectCrystal with only setfl file, ie some sort of constructor PerfectCrystal(setfl_file)
	-> mostly done but still have to read lattice constant and mass from parameter file.
	-> make reading in algorithm in EamSetfl more robust to unexpected whitespace
